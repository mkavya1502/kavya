# 🧠 GenAI-Powered Data Documentation Assistant

## 📌 Overview
This project uses a Generative AI model (GPT-4 via OpenAI API) to auto-generate intelligent documentation for tabular datasets. It combines LLM-based prompt engineering with basic data profiling to help data engineers and analysts quickly understand the structure, semantics, and quality of their datasets.

## 🎯 Features
- Auto-generate dataset summary from CSV/Parquet files
- Explain columns, data types, and relationships in natural language
- Integrate with `pandas-profiling` for stats and visual summaries
- Streamlit-based interactive UI for easy exploration
- Designed for modern data engineering workflows and metadata generation

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenAI API / LangChain (optional)
- Pandas, Pandas Profiling
- Streamlit
- Faker (optional for synthetic data)
- Jupyter Notebooks
